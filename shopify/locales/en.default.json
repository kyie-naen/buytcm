The language passed down and circulated is ‘He Luo’ dialect. Through changes in dynasties and generations, and following the migration south during the Five Barbarians’ invasion, the traditions came to Taiwan. With reverence for the past, passed down from father to son, the authentic practices of selecting, grading, writing, and preparing traditional Chinese medicine have been preserved for over two thousand years.
